less/* is taken directly from the bootstrap source, with responsive* removed just for neatness.
css/* is a generated sample, hand compared to the bootstrap distribution and taken as equivalent.

Bootstrap is normally built with Recess rather than the standard Less compiler.  Unfortunately this prevents direct comparison against the Bootstrap distributed CSS.
